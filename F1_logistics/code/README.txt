Libraries Used:

| Library       | Purpose                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| numpy         | Random sampling and statistics    |
| matplotlib    | Plotting results                  |
| geographiclib | Great-circle distance calculation |
| folium        | Interactive circuit map generation|


HOW TO RUN:
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the simulation:
   python main.py

Notes:
- PERT distributions were used to simulate randomness with a bias toward the most likely outcome.
- Race calendar and distances were calculated using actual coordinates and timelines.
- The simulation was designed to mimic the planning decisions a real F1 logistics manager would take.
